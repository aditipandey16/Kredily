Human Resource management System 
The HRMS project is a simple Human Resource Management System designed for managing employee details and marking attendance and it also displays the count of employees in each department.
You need to have Django installed in the system.
When the command 
python manage.py runserver runs it gives us a landing page which shows us the names and ids of all the current employees.
This page also contains the links which takes us to the page where we can add employees and also to the page which shows the employee count in each department.
The names of the Employees are in the form of links which when clicked will take us to the page containing the details of the particular employee. This page has the link to mark the attendance where we have to enter attendance date and the status.
The status gets updated in the employee details page as well.
SQLite Database is used for this application.

THANKYOU AND LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH KREDILY AND DEVELOPING BETTER APPLICATIONS AND GAINING MAXIMUM KNOWLEDGE.
